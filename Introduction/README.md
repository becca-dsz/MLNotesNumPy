# Introduction to NumPY

The array object is called ndarray.
NumPy arrays are created using the array() function.

<br>

NumPy provides convenient methods to create arrays initialized with specific values like zeros and ones

<br>

Basic indexing in NumPy allows you to access elements of an array using indices

<br>

Just like lists in Python, NumPy arrays can be sliced. As arrays can be multidimensional, you need to specify a slice for each dimsnion of the array

<br>

Advanced indexing in NumPy provides more powerful and flexible ways to access and manipulate array elements

<br>

We can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly on NumPy arrays

<br>

Unary operations are applied to each individual element in the array, without the need for multiple arrays (as in binary operations)

<br>

NumPy Binary Operations apply to the array elementwise and a new array is created. We can use all basic arithmetic operators like +,-,/, etc. In the case of +=,-=,= operators, the existing array is modified

<br>

NumPy provides familiar mathematical functions such as sin, cos, exp, etc. These functions also operate elementwise on an array, producing a array as output

<br>

We can use simple np.sort() method for sorting Python NumPy arrays
